# mrnote
Ever wanted your notes to be accesible from everywhere and be able to share them? Say hello to mrnote.
## In action
Currently down.
Just clone the repo and try it!
## Usage
It's simple.
On the start site, you can create a new noteboard.
Give it a cool name, a not too complicated key and you are ready to go.
You can decide if you want to make your board publicly available or not.
What's the difference? If it's public, at entrance no key is requested.

Later on, if you want to edit your board, you need to enter the correct URL:
	mrnote.xyz/:yourBoardName/:yourBoardPassword
Now you can add, remove or edit notes.

If the password is left away, the board can't be edited, but only viewed (if it's public).

Now, share your board by a link!
